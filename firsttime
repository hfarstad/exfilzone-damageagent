## First time setup

#If you get a permissions error when launching the damageagent, run this once in PowerShell as administrator:
```powershell
Unblock-File -Path .\exfildamageagent.ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#Then run the script normally by launching by doubleclicking the .ps1 file,right clickING the script.ps1 and press run in powershell..

#downloaded scripts may also need to be "unblocked". find the downloaded script file and right clicking it → Properties → Unblock → OK before running.
